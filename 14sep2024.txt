1. What is the purpose of a constructor in a C++ class?

Constructors are methods that are automatically executed every time you create an object. The purpose of a constructor is to construct an object and assign values to the object's members and prepare to use.


2. What is inheritance in C++ and what are its types?

 Inheritance is a feature in which one new class is derived from the existing ones. and child class access parent class property and method which depent upon access specifier and modifier.
inheritance types:
single inheritance, Multilevel inheritance,Multiple inheritance, hybrid inheritance , hierarchical inheritance

3. What is polymorphism in C++ and how can it be achieved?

Polymorphism in C++ allows us to reuse code by creating one function that's usable for multiple uses. 
It can be achieved in a two ways, including: 
Compile-time polymorphism : This is achieved by overloading functions or operators.

Run-time polymorphism : Also known as dynamic polymorphism, this is achieved through inheritance and virtual functions.


4.What is a virtual function in C++, and how does it contribute to polymorphism?

In C++, a virtual function is a member function in a base class that you can override in a derived class to achieve runtime polymorphism. By declaring a function as virtual, you ensure that the function call will be dynamically resolved based on the actual object's type, not the pointer or reference type used to call the function.




5. Explain the concept of data hiding in C++ and how it is implemented.

Data hiding in C++ refers to the principle of restricting access to certain details of an object or class, preventing external code from directly accessing or modifying them. 
Data hiding is primarily achieved using access specifiers in C++. These keywords control the visibility of class members (both data and functions) to external code.

private : this keyword define in which(parent) class then child class not access parent class property and method 

public:this keyword define in which(parent) class then child class  access all parent class property and method

protected:this keyword define in which(parent) class then child class  access some parent class property and method which depend upon access modifier in child class.


6. What is a friend function in C++, and when would you use it?
A friend function in C++ is a function that is not a member of a class but has permission to access the private and protected members of that class

A friend function is often used when an external function needs access to the internal state of a class but should not be a member of that class.
